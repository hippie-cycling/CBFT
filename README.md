# CBFT [Cipher Brute Force Toolkit]

A comprehensive console-based toolkit designed for cryptanalysis and cipher breaking.
This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including Vigenere, Gromark, Gronsfeld, XOR and Modulo addition/subtraction.
More ciphers to be implemented, **WIP**

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- Bruteforce using 350k English words.
- XOR decryptor and brute forcer.
- Modulo addition and subtraction decryptor and brute forcer.
- IoC based analysis.
- Frequency based analysis.

To run the program, download the repository and launch main.py.
