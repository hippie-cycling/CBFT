# CBFT [Cipher Brute Force Toolkit]

A comprehensive console-based toolkit designed for cryptanalysis and cipher breaking.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27209098-d9f5-44da-b79d-671123d2d418)

This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including:
- Vigenere
- Gromark
- Gronsfeld
- Autoclave/Autokey
- Hill
- XOR
- Caesar Shift
- Modulo addition/subtraction
- String Matrix Generator

It also provides some basic tools such as:
- Ioc
- Frequency Analysis

More ciphers and tools to be implemented, **WIP**

Features include:

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- Bruteforce using 350k English words.
- Bruteforce (Hill) using all possible 2x2 or 3x3 matrix keys.
- XOR decryptor and brute forcer.
- Modulo addition and subtraction decryptor and brute forcer.
- IoC based analysis. Range defined by the user.
- Frequency based analysis. Sensibility defined by the user.
- Generation of all possible n x m matrices.
- Saving results to files.

To run the program, download the repository and launch main.py.
