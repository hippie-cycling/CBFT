This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including:
- Autoclave/Autokey
- Caesar
- Columnar Transposition
- Four-Square
- Gromark
- Gronsfeld
- Hill
- Modular Addition/Subtraction
- Playfair
- Vigenere
- XOR

It also provides some basic tools such as:
- Frequency Analysis
- Index of Coincidence (IoC)
- String Matrix Generator

More ciphers and tools to be implemented, **WIP**

## Features include:

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- Bruteforce using 450k English-Latin words.
- Multiple attack modes for various ciphers, including dictionary attacks, exhaustive searches, and heuristic algorithms (Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing).
- XOR, Modulo addition and subtraction decryptor and brute forcer.
- IoC-based analysis. Range defined by the user.
- Frequency-based analysis. Sensibility defined by the user.
- Generation of all possible n x m matrices.
- Saving results to files.

To run the program, download the repository and launch main.py.
