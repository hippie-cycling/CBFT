This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including:
- Vigenere
- Gromark
- Gronsfeld
- Autoclave/Autokey
- XOR
- Modulo addition/subtraction.

More ciphers to be implemented, **WIP**

Features include:

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- Bruteforce using 350k English words.
- XOR decryptor and brute forcer.
- Modulo addition and subtraction decryptor and brute forcer.
- IoC based analysis. Range defined by the user.
- Frequency based analysis. Sensibility defined by the user.

To run the program, download the repository and launch main.py.
