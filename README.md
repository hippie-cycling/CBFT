# CBFT [Cipher Brute Force Toolkit]

A comprehensive console-based toolkit designed for cryptanalysis and cipher breaking.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3879cb8-c873-4ef2-b257-a48b460dc714)

This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including:
- Vigenere
- Gromark
- Gronsfeld
- Autoclave/Autokey
- XOR
- Modulo addition/subtraction
- String Matrix Generator

More ciphers to be implemented, **WIP**

Features include:

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- Bruteforce using 350k English words.
- XOR decryptor and brute forcer.
- Modulo addition and subtraction decryptor and brute forcer.
- IoC based analysis. Range defined by the user.
- Frequency based analysis. Sensibility defined by the user.
- Generation of all possible n x m matrices.

To run the program, download the repository and launch main.py.
