# CBFT [Cipher Brute Force Tool]

A comprehensive console-based toolkit designed for cryptanalysis and cipher breaking.
This toolkit provides methods for brute forcing various classical ciphers including Vigenere, Gromark, and Gronsfeld.
More ciphers to be implemented, **WIP**

- Customizable alphabet support.
- Known Plaintext list-based attack.
- IoC based analysis.
- Frequency based analysis.
- XOR decriptor and brute forcer.
